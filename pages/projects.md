A unique mix of first person shooting and turn based tactics. Robo Revolution was developed during my time at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo for CSC 476 Real-time Computer Graphics Software. I led the development of the game with a team of three other developers. The game is developed using C++ and OpenGL <br>

Developed for the 2022 Game Maker's Toolkit (GMTK) Game Jam where three other developers and I worked with Unity to create a game following the jams theme of "Roll of the Dice". In our game Born To Die players must fight their way through numerous enemies on their way to escape from hell. The game has players moving across a map inspired by board games and getting through encounters with turn based combat.<br>
